<p class="cool">Ballet has its origins in 15th century Italy. It was brought to France sometime between the 15th and 16th century when Catherine de Medici of Italy married the French King Henry II. Until 1681 the dances consisted of only men, as women were not allowed to dance in public at the time.</p>
<p class="cool">Early styles of ballet were based on location; French style, Russian style, and Italian style. The 19th century, or the romantic era, brought romantic style ballet. This era brought the iconic white tutu, pointe work and plots meant to bring the audience intense emotions.</p>

<p class="cool">Classical style ballet comes next and is indicated by related technqiues. What may be the most well known ballets, The Nutcracker and Swan Lake, fall into this style. </p>
<p class="cool">Neoclassical style goes against the grain. It is not strict in plot, set, or costumes. It is less formal and focuses on athletics rather than delicate precision. </p>
<p class="cool">Contemporary ballet is the last one. It takes from all other styles of ballet and dance. It combines acting and miming with the dance, and allows for plenty of experimentation. </p>
